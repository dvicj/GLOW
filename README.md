# GLOW

GOALS: 

1. A database that has all of my skincare products arranged by categories/types. 
2. Depending on the day and time (AM/PM) a routine will be generated. 
3. Eventually create routines based on specific skin concerns for that day. 
4. Eventually create database of all makeup products and create a randomized list of products to use each day to maximize how many products I use and make sure all are used frequently and equally.
